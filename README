==== A collection of interesting javascript snippets that we are working on ;-) ====

1) progres_bar -- A Jquery based progress bar class

2) star_rating/* -- A star rating JS widget based on prototype's slider.js
   *) This approach uses a single image which is used to render all there cases of stars (full, half full, empty) using percentage based background-positioning.

3) tab_widget/* -- A widget to create tabs for your links with content in the same page

4) text_limiter/* -- A widget that dynamically tracks the number of characters that can be typed in a textarea/box. Uses an html attribute named: maxlength. Refer to text_limiter/index.html for example.
